🎰 Core Game Mechanics
Implement 7 unique slot games, each with their own rules and graphics:
🎮 Game List:
1.	Mines – Grid-based game where players avoid hidden mines and can cash out early.
2.	Crash – A multiplier that rises until it crashes. Players must cash out before it does.
3.	Plinko – Ball drops through a pegboard and lands in random multiplier zones.
4.	Hi-Lo – Card-based game; guess if the next card is higher or lower.
5.	Dice Roll – Roll between 1–100, with adjustable risk levels.
6.	Slot 777 – Traditional slot machine.
7.	Roulette – Classic spinning wheel roulette game.
🔔 Each slot game has a 0–10% chance to win $MOBY, the platform’s main cryptocurrency token. And have a how to play guide.
